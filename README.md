# Maze Game

Explore the labyrinth in the "Maze" project, an interactive web-based game that challenges players to navigate through a dynamically generated maze to find the goal. Built with Matter.js, this project showcases physics-based movements and collision detection, offering an engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** Each game loads with a unique maze layout, ensuring a fresh challenge every time.
- **Physics-Based Interaction:** Control a ball through the maze using keyboard inputs, experiencing realistic movement and collision effects.
- **Goal Achievement:** Navigate the ball to the goal area to win, triggering a celebratory message and effect.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy the game on any device thanks to a layout that adjusts to fit the screen size of smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) - A 2D physics engine for the web

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply clone the project to your local machine, open the `index.html` file in a web browser, and start navigating through the maze.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- Internet access for loading Matter.js from CDN (if not locally available).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/s2a31/maze-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd maze-game
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the ball.
- Navigate through the maze to reach the green goal area.
- Avoid hitting the walls to reach your destination faster.

## Customization

Feel free to fork this project and customize the maze generation logic, aesthetics, or physics properties to create your own version of the maze game.
